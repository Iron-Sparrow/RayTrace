# RayTrace

RayTace.py is a project to write a ray tracer in Python3.

## What are the differences ?

### V1

The V1 is a modified version of the code from the Medium arcticle. It's currently deprecated as we decided to work on the V2 and possible V3.

### V2

The V2 is an upgraded V1, it adds multiple features including but not limited to:

* Using a faster method using .pyc files.
* Having a better material system.
* Adding two types of Anti-Aliasing (SSAA, SMAA), not done yet.

### V3 - Not ready yet, only project

The V3 will be a complete rewrite to use the GPU instead of the CPU, currently Glumpy but it might (probably) change.

## How does it work ?

### V1

The V1 one is a copy of the medium article code using another system for the materials: no dictionary.

### V2
